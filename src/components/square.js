/* 
In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain 
a render method and donâ€™t have their own state. Instead of defining a class which 
extends React.Component, we can write a function that takes props as input 
and returns what should be rendered. 
Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.
